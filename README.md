# Gortex

[![CI](https://github.com/zzet/gortex/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zzet/gortex/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/zzet/gortex)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/zzet/gortex)

Code intelligence engine that indexes repositories into an in-memory knowledge graph and exposes it via CLI, MCP Server, and web UI.

Built for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) — one `smart_context` call replaces 5-10 file reads, cutting token usage by ~94%.

## Features

- **Knowledge graph** — every file, symbol, import, call chain, and type relationship in one queryable structure
- **25 languages** — Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, C, C++, Bash, SQL, Protobuf, Markdown, HTML, CSS, YAML, TOML, HCL, Dockerfile
- **28 MCP tools** — symbol lookup, call chains, blast radius, community detection, process discovery, and 6 agent-optimized tools
- **6 MCP resources** — lightweight graph context without tool calls
- **Watch mode** — surgical graph updates on file change, live sync with agents
- **Web UI** — Sigma.js force-directed visualization with node size proportional to importance
- **IMPLEMENTS inference** — structural interface satisfaction for Go, TypeScript, Java, Rust, C#, Scala, Swift, Protobuf
- **PreToolUse hooks** — automatic graph context injection on Read and Grep
- **Benchmarked** — per-language parsing, query engine, indexer benchmarks
- **Zero dependencies** — everything runs in-process, in memory, no external services

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build (requires CGO for tree-sitter C bindings)
go build -o gortex ./cmd/gortex/

# Set up Gortex for a project (creates configs for Claude Code + Kiro IDE)
gortex init /path/to/repo

# Or with codebase analysis for a richer CLAUDE.md
gortex init --analyze /path/to/repo

# Index a repo and print stats
gortex status --index /path/to/repo

# Start MCP server with watch mode
gortex serve --index /path/to/repo --watch
```

## Usage with Claude Code

After running `gortex init`, Claude Code automatically starts Gortex via `.mcp.json`. The agent gets:

- **Slash commands:** `/gortex-guide`, `/gortex-explore`, `/gortex-debug`, `/gortex-impact`, `/gortex-refactor`
- **Global skills:** installed to `~/.claude/skills/` — available across all repos
- **PreToolUse hook:** automatic graph context on Read/Grep calls
- **CLAUDE.md instructions:** mandatory tool usage table and session workflow

## Usage with Kiro

`gortex init` also sets up Kiro IDE integration automatically:

- **MCP server:** `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` — all 28 tools auto-approved for zero-friction use
- **Steering files:** `.kiro/steering/gortex-workflow.md` (always active) teaches Kiro to prefer graph queries over file reads. Additional manual steering files for explore, debug, impact, and refactor workflows are available via `#` in chat.
- **Agent hooks:**
  - `gortex-smart-context` — on each prompt, assembles task-relevant context from the graph in one call
  - `gortex-post-edit` — after saving source files, shows blast radius and which tests to run
  - `gortex-pre-read` — before reading source files, enriches with symbol context from the graph

## CLI Commands

```
gortex init [path]           Set up Gortex for a project + install global skills
gortex serve [flags]         Start the MCP server
gortex index [path]          Index a repository and print stats
gortex status [flags]        Show index status
gortex query <subcommand>    Query the knowledge graph
gortex clean                 Remove Gortex files from a project
gortex claude-md [flags]     Generate CLAUDE.md block
gortex version               Print version
```

### Query Subcommands

```
gortex query symbol <name>              Find symbols matching name
gortex query deps <id>                  Show dependencies
gortex query dependents <id>            Show blast radius
gortex query callers <func-id>          Show who calls a function
gortex query calls <func-id>            Show what a function calls

All query commands support `--format text|json|dot` (DOT output for Graphviz visualization).

## Web UI

When running `gortex serve`, a web visualization is available at `http://localhost:8765`:

- Sigma.js force-directed graph with ForceAtlas2 layout
- Node size proportional to degree (connection count = importance)
- Color-coded by kind (function, type, interface, method, variable, file)
- Real-time updates via SSE when watch mode is active
- Filter by node kind, hide test files, search by name
- Click nodes to highlight neighborhood

## Architecture

```
gortex binary
  CLI (cobra)  ──> Indexer ──> In-Memory Graph
  MCP Server ─────────────────> Query Engine
  Web Server ─────────────────> (Nodes + Edges + Indexes)
                   Watcher <── filesystem events (fsnotify)
```

**Data flow:**
1. Indexer walks the directory, dispatches files to language-specific extractors (tree-sitter)
2. Extractors produce nodes (files, functions, types, etc.) and edges (calls, imports, defines, etc.)
3. Resolver links cross-file references and infers interface implementations
4. Query Engine answers traversal queries over the live graph
5. Watcher detects changes and surgically patches the graph (debounced per-file)

## Graph Schema

**Node kinds:** `file`, `function`, `method`, `type`, `interface`, `variable`, `import`, `package`

**Edge kinds:** `calls`, `imports`, `defines`, `implements`, `extends`, `references`, `member_of`, `instantiates`
